# Data Cleaning (Python / Excel)

A small, focused repo for practicing **data cleaning in Python**. The main work lives in a Jupyter notebook where the dataset is loaded, inspected, cleaned, and prepared for analysis or downstream modeling.

## Cleaning workflow (high level)

Inside the notebook, the workflow is structured around common “real-world” cleaning steps, such as:

- Loading Excel data into a dataframe
- Inspecting schema (dtypes), missingness, duplicates, and invalid values
- Standardizing column names and text fields (trim, case normalization)
- Converting data types (dates/numbers/categoricals) safely
- Handling missing values (drop, fill, or rule-based imputation)
- Producing a cleaner dataset ready for analysis
